  <h2> Meet The Cats</h2>
    <p> Here are the profiles of each of our adoptable cats.
      Make a reservation and come meet them! If you and one of our resident
      cats hit it off, you can apply to adopt!
      We partner with the local shelters in the surrounding areas to do our
      best to find these felines their furever homes. If you want to check out
      more adoptable cats check out the Bloomington Animal Shelter

            Bones is a fiesty long haired half Maine coon who
            is quite talkative. He loves attention and pets but on his own terms.
            Don't dare initiate petting or pick him up. He will give
            you a warning, but ignore at your own risk. That being said,
            if you respect his boundaries he might honor you by laying on your lap
            or next to you while you sleep.
